# Downloader

An Windows Store App developed in C# that allows downloading any file in background. It supports pausing/resuming of downloads and multi-part downloads.


> Note
> Since Windows can destroy even background running apps when necessary and since there is no way to prevent this, this app seems less useful and is now discontinued.
